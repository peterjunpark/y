# Next.js 13 Template

This template provides a more optimized starting point for Next.js projects using the [App router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) and TypeScript.

## Styling

It features enhanced DX for TailwindCSS by incorporating [`clsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) and [`tailwind-merge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) to handle conditional Tailwind classes while predictably resolving class conflicts. [`Prettier`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) is configured to automatically sort Tailwind classes.

A barebones dark-mode toggle is implemented using [`next-themes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
